  <h1>Your Contribution</h1>

  <p>
    To enter the Guild, there is a <strong>$20 contribution</strong>.  
    This is not a fee — it is your commitment to the movement we are building.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once you pay, <strong>the device you used becomes your permanent access key</strong>.  
    Access cannot be transferred or shared.  
    The payment itself is the key.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may share the payment link or QR code with others, but each person must pay on their own device.  
    This keeps the Guild protected and ensures every member enters with intention.
  </p>

  <h1>Referral Rewards</h1>

  <p>
    The Guild rewards those who help the movement grow.  
    For every person you refer who completes their $20 contribution,  
    <strong>you receive $5 back</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    To make sure you receive your reward, the person you refer must  
    <strong>include your name and your email</strong> when they pay.
  </p>

  <p>
    This ensures the system knows exactly who sent them,  
    and it allows us to credit you properly for strengthening the Guild.
  </p>

  <h1>The Guild Family</h1>

  <p>
    When you enter the Guild, you are not just joining a program —  
    <strong>you are becoming part of a family</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Inside the Guild, we look out for each other.  
    We support each other.  
    We grow together.  
    If one of us falls, we all reach down and pull them back up.
  </p>

  <p>
    I will be more than just someone teaching you the Million Dollar Move.  
    I will be a guide, a mentor, and someone who genuinely wants to see you win.  
    And the Guild will be filled with people who feel the same way.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once you enter, you are <strong>officially part of the Guild forever</strong>.  
    You will never walk this journey alone again.
