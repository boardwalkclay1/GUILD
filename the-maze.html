  <h1>The Maze</h1>

  <p>
    Imagine a massive maze outside your town.  
    People enter and never return.  
    I have been inside that maze.  
    I have fought through it.  
    I carry the battle scars to prove it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Only one person can enter at a time — but before you enter, you get to speak to someone
    who survived it.  
    I will guide you through every turn.
  </p>
