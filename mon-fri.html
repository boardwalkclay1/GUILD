    <h1>Mon–Fri: The Weekly Decay Window</h1>

    <p>
      Inside the Guild, you will learn one of the most important truths about options trading:
      <strong>contracts lose value every single day of the week.</strong>
      This is called <strong>time decay</strong>, and it is the reason Friday becomes our greatest opportunity.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the week goes on, contracts get cheaper and cheaper.  
      By Friday, they are at their absolute lowest price — and that is when the Guild strikes.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Friday Is Our Million Dollar Window</h2>

    <p>
      On Friday, options contracts are so cheap that people buy them in massive quantities.
      When the market moves, it moves <strong>hard</strong> — because thousands of traders are loading up on
      low‑priced contracts at the same time.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is where the Guild finds its opportunity.
      Contracts worth $5, $4, $3, $2, even $1 become available — and you can buy <strong>hundreds</strong> or even
      <strong>thousands</strong> at a time.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the market makes its move, those cheap contracts multiply fast.
      This is the foundation of the Million Dollar Move.
    </p>

    <h2>Weekly Contract Decay Example</h2>

    <p>
      Below is a simple diagram showing how a contract’s price typically falls from Monday to Friday.
      This is not a prediction — it is an example to help you understand the pattern.
    </p>

    <div class="chart-box">
      <h3>Example 1: A $5 Contract</h3>
      <table class="decay-table">
        <tr><th>Day</th><th>Price</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Monday</td><td>$5.00</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Tuesday</td><td>$4.00</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Wednesday</td><td>$3.00</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Thursday</td><td>$2.00</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Friday</td><td>$1.00</td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>

    <div class="chart-box">
      <h3>Example 2: A $50 Contract</h3>
      <table class="decay-table">
        <tr><th>Day</th><th>Price</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Monday</td><td>$50.00</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Tuesday</td><td>$40.00</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Wednesday</td><td>$30.00</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Thursday</td><td>$20.00</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Friday</td><td>$10.00</td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>

    <p>
      This is why the Guild loves Fridays.  
      This is why the Guild waits.  
      This is why the Guild strikes with precision.
    </p>

    <h2>Understanding the Pattern</h2>

    <p>
      • Contracts lose value every day  
      • The closer you get to expiration, the faster they decay  
      • Friday contracts are the cheapest  
      • Cheap contracts = more quantity  
      • More quantity = more multiplication  
      • More multiplication = the Million Dollar Move  
    </p>

    <p>
      This is the rhythm of the market.  
      This is the weekly cycle we take advantage of.  
      This is the window where discipline meets opportunity.
